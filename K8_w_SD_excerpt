# motivations:
# to minimally gain experience scaling compute securely 
# so as not to leave idle or increase costs unnecessary 
# after use or downtime for self and users.
# setting up using Gu's article or other similar articles
# geared towards cloud orchestrating AI would 
# progress me towards hosting my own services for 
# OpenCollective media translation and collaboration 
# (website, whisper, mistral openWebUI)
# 
# additional benefits include
# 1) LoRA for training SD on personal images
# which can optionally help in Collective Expression project
# since optimally we want expressions to be trained on other platforms
# 2) we can try the open webUI version that will get us 1st steps for
# media learning, and then for our own cloud version (uses gradio instead of svelte)

# checklist:
# 1) access aws cloud
# 2) check victor gu repo and source
# 3) spin up orchestration and stable diffusion 
# 4) refer to docs, cgpt n files to try different compute arch. exercises


# make sure:
# 1) to close or lower cloud compute n orchestration effectively
# after use to lower costs

# 2) access is secure yet scalable (ingress-nginx)
